maturin[EXE]-sdist 
Build only a source distribution (sdist) without compiling.

Building a source distribution requires a pyproject.toml with a `[build-system]` table.

This command is a workaround for [pypa/pip#6041](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/6041)

USAGE:
    maturin[EXE] sdist [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS:
    -m, --manifest-path <MANIFEST_PATH>
            The path to the Cargo.toml

    -o, --out <OUT>
            The directory to store the built wheels in. Defaults to a new "wheels" directory in the
            project's target directory

    -h, --help
            Print help information
